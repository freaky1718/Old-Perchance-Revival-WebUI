**‚ú® Important Update: 11/06/2025 - Enhanced Portability & Local Model Caching! ‚ú®**

Perchance Revival has been updated for better model management!

*   **Models Now Local:** All Hugging Face Hub models selected through this app will now be downloaded and cached into the `checkpoints` folder located directly within the Perchance Revival application directory.
*   **Fully Portable:** This change makes the entire application, along with its models, self-contained and easily portable.
*   **No Global Cache Usage:** The app will no longer use your main Hugging Face user cache directory (e.g., `~/.cache/huggingface` or `C:\Users\<username>\.cache\huggingface`) for models it downloads.

#### 11/06/2025 - email model suggestions to: raxephion@yahoo.com (models you think might have been used by perchance and/or models you'd like to see in the app)
#### 11/06/2025 - Added 3 more models/presets for variety while perchance models are still being hunted down. Fixed update.bat - busy testing

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Early Development Notice**  
> This app is still in **very early development**. It can already generate images successfully, but expect bugs, missing polish, and future changes (including some big ones). It‚Äôs functional but **not production-ready yet**. Stability is good so far, but this is more of an early preview than a final release.

Welcome to **Perchance Revival**! This is a user-friendly Gradio web application designed to bring back the experience of the old Perchance image generator by featuring the specific Stable Diffusion 1.5 models and common generation parameters/presets it used.

Generate images effortlessly and for free, directly on your own PC. This version is designed to **prioritize and utilize your NVIDIA GPU** for significantly faster generation if you have one, while still offering a CPU option for broader compatibility. The goal is to make local SD 1.5 generation as simple as possible, especially for those familiar with the old Perchance site.

This project is primarily designed for **Windows** users, offering a straightforward setup with easy-to-use batch files. Manual setup options are also provided for other platforms or advanced users.


## ‚ú® Features

- **Device Agnostic:**
  - Run inference on your **CPU**. (inference time around 4:55 with 10th gen i5 ‚Äî not bad for an oven).
  - Leverage your **NVIDIA GPU** for significantly faster generation (Euler 30 steps = 8 secs with 6GB VRAM). CUDA magic required.
- **Comprehensive Control:**
  - **Positive & Negative Prompts:** Guide the AI with detailed descriptions of what you want (and don‚Äôt want).
  - **Inference Steps:** Control the number of denoising steps, because 20 just doesn‚Äôt feel lucky enough sometimes.
  - **CFG Scale:** Adjust how strongly the image should conform to your prompt ‚Äî or not. Live a little.
  - **Schedulers:** Experiment with different sampling algorithms (Euler, DPM++ 2M, DDPM, LMS) until you find your personal flavor of chaos.
  - **Image Sizes:** Choose from standard SD1.5 resolutions, plus a "hire.fix" option (interpreted as 1024x1024 because that's what people usually mean anyway).
  - **Seed Control:** Set a specific seed for reproducible results. Or use -1 and see what the universe decides.
- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  - Clean and intuitive Gradio UI.
  - Organized controls with advanced settings tucked away neatly ‚Äî like secrets.
  - Direct image display with download and share options.
- **Safety First (Note):** The built-in safety checker is **disabled** in this version to allow for maximum creative freedom. Use responsibly. (We see you.)

## üöÄ Prerequisites
- **Windows Operating System:** The provided batch files (`.bat`) are for Windows. For other operating systems, follow the manual setup steps below (warning: includes actual typing).
- **Python:** 3.8 or higher. Ensure Python is installed and added to your system's PATH (usually an option during installation). You can download Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
- **Git:** (Required for manual setup and updating) For cloning the repository.
- **Hardware:**
  - A modern CPU is required.
  - For GPU acceleration (optional but highly recommended for speed), a compatible NVIDIA GPU with up-to-date CUDA drivers. At least 6‚Äì8GB VRAM is recommended for 512x512 generation, more for larger sizes.
  - **Important:** The correct CUDA version for your drivers is critical. Use `nvidia-smi` in the command prompt to check your driver's compatible CUDA version. Or guess wildly ‚Äî up to you.
- **Internet Connection:** Required for downloading models from Hugging Face Hub and for updates. Sorry, it doesn't generate dreams offline (yet).

## üì¶ Easy Setup (Windows - Download & Run)

This is the recommended and easiest method for most Windows users.

1.  **Download the project:**
    *   Go to the GitHub repository page: `https://github.com/Raxephion/Old-Perchance-Revival-WebUI`
    *   Click the green "<> Code" button.
    *   Click "Download ZIP".
2.  **Extract the ZIP:** Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location on your computer (e.g., your Documents folder or Desktop). This will create a folder like `Old-Perchance-Revival-WebUI-main` (or similar). You can rename it if you prefer, for example, to `PerchanceRevival`.
3. **Choose Your Setup Script:**
   - **For CPU Inference:** Run `setup-CPU.bat`. This will install the CPU version of PyTorch.
   - **For GPU Inference:** Run `setup-GPU.bat`. This will attempt to install the CUDA-enabled version of PyTorch.
4. **Run the Setup Script:**
   - Navigate into the extracted folder.
   - **Double-click either `setup-CPU.bat` or `setup-GPU.bat`** depending on whether you want CPU or GPU inference.
   - A command prompt window will open. Follow the instructions in the window. This script will create a Python virtual environment (`venv`), install all necessary core dependencies, and install the appropriate version of PyTorch.
   - **Important:** Read the output in the command prompt carefully during and after the script finishes.
     - **If using `setup-GPU.bat` and the CUDA installation fails:** The script will provide instructions on how to troubleshoot the CUDA installation or how to install the CPU version of PyTorch as a fallback. There's no shame in going back to CPU. Okay, maybe a little.


## üîÑ Updating the Application (Windows - Easy Method)
To get the latest code, dependency updates and updated models from this repository after using the easy setup:
- Navigate to the project folder.
- Double-click `update.bat` to run it.
- A command prompt window will open and pull the latest changes from the GitHub repository and upgrade the Python packages in your virtual environment. Congratulations, you are now slightly more modern.


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application (Windows - Easy Method)

Once the setup is complete (including successful PyTorch installation, whether GPU or CPU), launch the Gradio web UI by double-clicking the `run.bat` file in your project folder (e.g., `PerchanceRevival`).

*   A command prompt window will open, activate the environment, and start the application.
*   A browser window should automatically open to the application (or a local URL will be provided in the console, usually `http://127.0.0.1:7860`).
